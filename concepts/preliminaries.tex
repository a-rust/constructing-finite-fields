\section{What are these notes?}

These are some personal notes that hopefully provide some intuition on how to construct a finite field from a quotient ring.

This starts from scratch (defining a group), and builds up with only relevant information. As a result, lots of concepts taught in a standard abstract algebra course are left out. An understanding of cosets may be useful, but not really necessary.

Most of these notes are definitions and examples. There are only really a few theorems needed to actually construct a finite field from a quotient ring. The proofs of the theorems mentioned are not included.
