\section{Irreducible polynomials}

\begin{definition}
Let $F$ be a field. An irreducible polynomial $p(x) \in F[x]$ is a polynomial that has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The degree of $p(x) \geq 2$
    \item If $p(x) = f(x)h(x)$ for some polynomials $f(x), h(x) \in F[x]$, then either the degree of $f(x)=0$ or the degree of $h(x)=0$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Basically, an irreducible polynomial $p(x)$ cannot be broken into smaller, non-unit parts. The first property guarantees we can't factor a constant out of $p(x)$, like $4x + 4 = 4(x+1)$, since a constant is a unit. The second property guarantees that if we can reduce $p(x)$ into two smaller parts, then one of the smaller parts must be a unit.
